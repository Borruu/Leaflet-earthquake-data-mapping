# leaflet-challenge
Objective: to visualise earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every minute (source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
The files contained in folder Leaflet-Part-1 map all earthquakes that have occurred in the the past 7 days. The size of each marker is indicative of the earthquake's magnitude (50,000 metres * magnitude).
The depth of each earthquake is indicated by colour, as per the legend provided.
